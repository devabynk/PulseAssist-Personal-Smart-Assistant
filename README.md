**PulseAssist** is a state-of-the-art, AI-powered personal assistant built with Flutter. It combines the power of multiple LLMs via **Groq** (GPT-OSS 120B, Llama 4 Scout, Whisper V3) with a custom local NLP engine to provide a seamless, intuitive, and high-performance user experience across all major platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> **Project Status**: Most core features are fully functional. We are currently finalizing UI refinements and localization polishing.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Chatbot — "Mina" (Multi-Model AI)
- **Hybrid AI Architecture**: Leverages multiple state-of-the-art models for specialized tasks:
  - **Reasoning & Chat**: Powered by **GPT-OSS 120B** (Primary) via Groq.
  - **Interactive Slot Filling**: The assistant intelligently asks for missing details (e.g., "What time for the alarm?") instead of guessing.
  - **Offline Smart Chat**: Even without internet, the Local NLP engine tracks conversation context to support multi-turn commands naturally.
- **Full AI CRUD Operations**: Beyond simple chat, the AI can directly **create, read, update, delete, and list**:
  - ⏰ **Alarms**: Smart time parsing, recurring settings, update/delete by time, and **Native System Ringtones**.
  - 📝 **Notes**: Structured note creation with template support (Shopping, Meeting, To-Do), append content, color coding.
  - 🔔 **Reminders**: Priority-based tasks (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `urgent`) with subtasks, toggle completion, and local notifications.
  - 📊 **Data Analysis**: AI can summarize your total alarms, notes, and reminders on demand.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**:
  - 👁️ **Vision & OCR**: Advanced object recognition and text extraction via **Llama 4 Scout 17B**.
  - 🎙️ **Audio Transcription**: High-accuracy voice-to-text using **Whisper Large V3**.
  - 📄 **Document Analysis**: Upload and query **PDF**, **DOCX**, **XLSX**, **CSV**, and **TXT** files directly within the chat.

### 🎨 Rich Content Creation
- **Drawing Canvas**: Built-in drawing screen with touch support for sketches and handwritten notes.
- **Voice Notes**: Record, playback, and manage voice memos with the integrated audio recorder and player.
- **Rich Text Notes**: Full rich-text editing powered by **Flutter Quill** with masonry grid layout and color-coded categories.

### 📍 Local Services & Regional Optimization (TR)
- **Turkey-Specific Logic**: Many core features are currently optimized specifically for **Turkey**:
  - 🌦️ **Weather**: City and district search is tailored for Turkish administrative regions (81 provinces + districts), with USA states data also available.
  - 🏥 **Pharmacy**: Real-time "on-duty" (nöbetçi eczane) data via CollectAPI (TR focus).
  - 🎭 **Events**: Nearby event discovery via Ticketmaster localization for Turkey.
- **🌍 Multi-language Support**: Full support for both **Turkish (TR)** and **English (EN)**, with ARB-based localization adapting to system settings or manual choice.
- **🌓 Adaptive Themes**: Premium look with seamless switching between **Light** and **Dark** modes, powered by a comprehensive theme system with Google Fonts.
- **📊 Dashboard**: A beautiful, responsive dashboard providing a quick overview of your day with weather, alarms, reminders, and more.

### 📱 Home Screen Widgets
- **Android Home Widget**: Quick-glance widget for your dashboard data directly on your home screen, powered by `home_widget` integration.
  - Weather, alarms, reminders, and notes widgets available
  - iOS widget support is planned for a future release

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **Local-First Data**: All notes, alarms, and reminders are stored locally using **Hive CE** (NoSQL) + **SQLite**, providing blazing fast performance without cloud dependencies.
- **Secure Exports**: Backup and restore your data via encrypted ZIP files.
- **Secret Management**: API keys are managed via a local-only configuration file (`.gitignore`'d) to ensure security.
- **Multiple API Key Failover**: Supports multiple Groq API keys with automatic rotation when hitting rate limits (30 RPM / 14400 RPD per key).
- **Legal Compliance**: Built-in Privacy Policy and Terms of Use screens.
- **Notification History**: Built-in notification log to review past alarm and reminder alerts

### 📐 Responsive Design & Tablet Support
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Fully responsive UI for phones, tablets, and desktop
  - **Mobile**: Bottom navigation bar with 5 tabs
  - **Tablet/Desktop**: Sidebar navigation with labels, adaptive grid layouts
  - **Portrait/Landscape**: Layout adapts to device orientation
- **Smart Grid System**: Notes and alarms switch between 2-column (portrait tablet) and 3-column (landscape tablet) grids
- **Adaptive Typography**: Text sizes and padding scale with screen size (16→32→48dp horizontal padding)
- **Tablet Dashboard**: Two-column dashboard layout on landscape tablets for better use of screen space

## ⚙️ How it Works

PulseAssist uses a hybrid approach to natural language understanding:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Input] --> B{Internet?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Groq AI Layer]
    B -->|No| D[Local NLP Engine]
    C --> E[Structured JSON Response]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Action Service]
    F --> G[Local Execution]
    G --> H[(Hive CE / SQLite)]
```

1.  **Local NLP Layer**: For simple, privacy-sensitive tasks, a custom NLP engine (built entirely in Dart) classifies intents, extracts entities with fuzzy matching, and preprocesses text — all without needing an internet connection.
2.  **AI Intelligence Layer**: For complex requests, vision tasks, document analysis, or audio transcription, the app leverages **Groq AI** with model-specific routing. The AI is instructed to return structured JSON, which the app's **Action Service** executes directly.
3.  **Local Execution**: All actions (like setting an alarm or saving a note) happen on the device, ensuring your data stays yours.

## 🔑 API Configuration

To use all features of PulseAssist, you need to provide your own API keys. We use a template-based approach to keep your keys safe.

> [!TIP]
> Supports **Multiple API Keys** (Failover) for uninterrupted service. If a primary key hits a rate limit, the system automatically switches to the next available key.

### 1. Register for API Keys

| Service | Purpose | Acquisition Link |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Groq AI** | Chat, Vision, Audio | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys) |
| **OpenWeatherMap** | Weather Forecasts | [home.openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) |
| **CollectAPI** | Pharmacy Data (TR) | [collectapi.com](https://collectapi.com/tr/api/health/nobetci-eczane-api) |
| **Ticketmaster** | Local Events | [developer.ticketmaster.com](https://developer.ticketmaster.com) |

### 2. Setup your local config

1.  Navigate to `lib/core/config/`.
2.  Copy `api_config.example.dart` and rename it to `api_config.dart`.
3.  Open `api_config.dart` and paste your keys into the corresponding fields.

> [!TIP]
> `api_config.dart` is already added to `.gitignore`, so your keys will never be accidentally committed to your repository.

### 🤖 Specialized AI Models

PulseAssist doesn't just use one model; it intelligently routes requests to the best available LLM for the task:

| Task | Model | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Chat & Logic** | `GPT-OSS 120B` | Advanced reasoning, structured JSON generation for CRUD actions. |
| **Vision & OCR** | `Llama 4 Scout 17B` | Analyzing images, identifying objects, and reading text from photos. |
| **Voice / Audio** | `Whisper Large V3` | Industry-leading transcription for voice notes and audio files. |

### 🧠 Local NLP Engine

The custom-built NLP engine runs entirely on-device with **zero latency** and **no internet required**:

| Component | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intent Classifier** | Detects user intent (create alarm, note, reminder, cancel, etc.) |
| **Entity Extractor** | Parses time, dates, labels, priorities, and other entities from text |
| **Fuzzy Matcher** | Handles typos and approximate matching for robust input parsing |
| **Preprocessor** | Normalizes and tokenizes input text for both TR and EN |
| **NLP Engine** | Orchestrates all components into a unified pipeline |
